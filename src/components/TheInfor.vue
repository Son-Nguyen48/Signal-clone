        State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by the open-source
        Signal Protocol) keeps your conversations secure. We can't read your
        messages or listen to your calls, and no one but you can. Privacy isn't
        offered as an option, it's just how Signal works. For all messages, for
        all calls, all the time.
